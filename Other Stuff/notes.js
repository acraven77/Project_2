// one main array for showing students either searched or not. so pagination and everything will just reference that array
//array is cleared every time and only students that need to be shown are in the show array

//Can have a search array for searching by name or email address

//might need a active array for each function to reference

//pagination function should clear students shown so I don't have to clear and run pagination separate
